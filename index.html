    <h1>Q&A</h1>
    <p>
    <b>Q1: </b>
    3 Differences:
    <br />

    <br />
    1. Creation of Content -
    <br />
    Web1 was a static web where the content was mainly created by web developers.
    <br />
    Web2 and Web3 are interactive webs where the content is created by users themselves.
    <br />
    <br />

    2. Uses -
    <br />
    Web1 was primarily a one-way communication medium, with the web pages consisting of static content that could not be
    updated in real-time.
    <br />
    Web2 introduced dynamic content, allowing users to interact with websites through social media platforms, blogs,
    wikis, and other interactive features.
    <br />
    Web3 is designed to provide even greater interactivity, with the ability to use smart contracts to automate
    processes and create decentralized applications.
    <br />
    <br />

    3. Commerce -
    <br />
    Web1 was primarily used for the distribution of information, with limited e-commerce capabilities.
    <br />
    Web2 introduced e-commerce and online transactions as well as social networking platforms.
    <br />
    Web3 is designed to provide an even greater level of security and privacy for e-commerce, enabling secure
    transactions that are not reliant on centralized intermediaries.
    <br />
    <br />
  </p>
    <br />
  <p>
    <b>Q2: </b>
    <br />

    A use case that would be different in Web1 and Web2 is online communication.
    <br />

    In Web1, online communication was mainly limited to email and basic chat rooms, and collaboration was mostly done
    through email
    attachments.

    Web1 lacked the real-time, interactive capabilities that Web2 provides.
    <br />
    With the emergence of Web2, communication and collaboration have become much more dynamic and interactive.
    <br />
    Web2 platforms such as social media, messaging apps, and online collaborative tools like Google Docs allow users to
    communicate in real-time, share and edit documents simultaneously.
